# Patent Declaration

## No Patents or Proprietary Rights

This project **explicitly disclaims all patent rights** and proprietary claims.

### Declaration

The creators and contributors of the Double-Blind Token System for Government Services project hereby declare that:

1. **No Patent Claims**: We make no patent claims on any algorithms, methods, systems, or implementations in this project.

2. **Public Domain Intent**: All novel ideas, algorithms, and methods are contributed to the public domain for the benefit of society.

3. **Free Use**: Anyone may use, modify, implement, and patent their own implementations based on this code without restriction.

4. **No Defensive Patents**: We will not file defensive patents or any other intellectual property claims on this work.

5. **Community Ownership**: This project belongs to the community and humanity, not to any individual or corporation.

## Specific Disclaimers

### Double-Blind Token System
The double-blind token encryption system (TE1 and TE2 layers) is **not patented** and is freely available for anyone to use and implement.

### Agentic RAG System
The multi-agent RAG system with Router, Grader, and Validator agents is **not patented** and is freely available for implementation.

### GraphRAG Implementation
The knowledge graph-based retrieval system is **not patented** and is freely available for use.

### Officer Assignment Algorithm
The workload-based assignment algorithm with hierarchy support is **not patented** and is freely available.

### All Other Innovations
Any and all other novel methods, algorithms, or systems in this project are **not patented** and are freely available.

## Why No Patents?

### Our Philosophy

1. **Public Good**: This project is built to eliminate corruption in government services worldwide. Patents would restrict access and defeat this purpose.

2. **Open Innovation**: We believe in open innovation where ideas build upon each other freely.

3. **Community Benefit**: The community benefits more from free access than from patent protection.

4. **Ethical Stance**: Patenting methods to fight corruption would be ethically inconsistent.

5. **Global Impact**: We want this technology to be adopted globally without legal barriers.

## What This Means for You

### You Can:
✅ Use all algorithms and methods in your own projects  
✅ Implement similar systems without legal concerns  
✅ Modify and improve upon our implementations  
✅ Use in commercial products without licensing fees  
✅ Patent your own novel improvements (though we encourage you not to)  
✅ Deploy in any country without legal restrictions  
✅ Teach and share these methods freely  

### You Cannot:
❌ Claim that we have patented these methods  
❌ Restrict others from using these methods  
❌ Sue us for patent infringement (there are no patents)  

## Prior Art

This document serves as **prior art** for all methods and algorithms in this project, preventing future patent claims by others.
