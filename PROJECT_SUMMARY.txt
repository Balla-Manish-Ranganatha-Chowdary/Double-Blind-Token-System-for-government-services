GOVERNMENT SERVICES PORTAL - DOUBLE-BLIND TOKEN SYSTEM
Full-Stack Application - Complete Implementation
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
A revolutionary platform that eliminates corruption in government service 
delivery through double-blind token encryption, ensuring citizens and officers 
cannot identify each other during the application review process.

TECH STACK
----------
Frontend:  Next.js 14 (React, TypeScript)
Backend:   Django 5.0 + Django REST Framework
Database:  PostgreSQL 15+
AI/ML:     PyPDF2, spaCy, transformers
Security:  Cryptography (Fernet AES-256)

IMPLEMENTED FEATURES
--------------------
✅ Three Complete Portals:
   - User Portal (Apply, Check Status, Home)
   - Officer Portal (Login, Dashboard, Review Applications)
   - Admin Portal (Login, Analytics, Manage Officers)

✅ Double-Blind Token System:
   - UUID generation
   - TE1 encryption (citizen view)
   - TE2 encryption (officer view)
   - Complete identity isolation

✅ Two AI Agents:
   - Classification AI (determines service category from PDFs)
   - Redaction AI (detects PII, auto-rejects if found)

✅ Automated Workflows:
   - Workload-based officer assignment
   - Multi-level approval routing
   - Hierarchy-aware forwarding
   - Status tracking

✅ Security Features:
   - Token-based authentication
   - No public signup (admin creates accounts)
   - Encrypted file storage
   - CORS protection
   - Audit trails

✅ Admin Analytics:
   - Total applications
   - Approval/rejection rates
   - Status breakdown
   - Officer workload distribution
   - Service category distribution
   - Time-based trends

QUICK START
-----------
1. Setup PostgreSQL database
2. Backend: cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Generate keys: python generate_keys.py
4. Create .env file with keys
5. Run migrations: python manage.py migrate
6. Create data: python setup_db.py
7. Start backend: python manage.py runserver
8. Frontend: cd frontend && npm install
9. Start frontend: npm run dev

ACCESS POINTS
-------------
Citizen Portal:  http://localhost:3000
Officer Login:   http://localhost:3000/officer/login
Admin Login:     http://localhost:3000/admin/login

DEFAULT CREDENTIALS
-------------------
Admin:    username=admin, password=admin123
Officer:  username=officer_revenue_1, password=officer123

KEY DOCUMENTS
-------------
README.md                    - Project overview & quick start
SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md        - Detailed setup guide
PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md          - Complete documentation
FUNCTIONALITY_CHECKLIST.md   - Feature verification
QUICK_REFERENCE.md           - Commands & URLs reference
docs/API.md                  - API endpoints
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md         - System architecture

APPLICATION WORKFLOW
--------------------
1. Citizen submits application with PDFs
2. System generates UUID → encrypts to TE1 → encrypts to TE2
3. AI scans for PII → auto-rejects if found
4. AI classifies service category
5. Auto-assigns to officer (workload-based)
6. Officer reviews (sees TE2 only, no citizen identity)
7. Officer approves/rejects
8. If multi-level needed → forwards to next hierarchy
9. Final status updated
10. Citizen tracks with TE1 token

SERVICE CATEGORIES
------------------
- Land Record (Revenue Department)
- Police Verification (Police Department)
- Ration Card (Civil Supplies)
- Vehicle Registration (Transport)
- Building Permission (Municipal)
- Revenue Mutation (Revenue)

SECURITY HIGHLIGHTS
-------------------
✓ Double-blind encryption prevents identity exposure
✓ AI auto-rejects documents with personal information
✓ No officer selection by citizens
✓ Workload-based assignment prevents manipulation
✓ Token-based API authentication
✓ No public signup for officers/admins
✓ Complete audit trails

UI/UX PHILOSOPHY
----------------

- Clean layouts with whitespace
- Functional over aesthetic
- Accessible and responsive
- Clear typography
